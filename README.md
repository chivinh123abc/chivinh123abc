- Hi! My name is Luong Chi Vinh (Ryan) and you can call me Vinh. I'm from Vietnam. I'm a beginner programmer who is passionate about technology and working hard to improve every day.

- Nice to meet you 👋. Maybe we are living in different countries. We speak different languages. Maybe we come from different backgrounds. But we share one thing in common — our passion for programming.

- I believe that learning never stops, and every small step today will build a stronger future tomorrow.

- Thank you for visiting my profile. Have a great day! ✨
